# stock-analysis
Analyzing stock using VBA.
## Overview of Project
### Background
Steve was hired by his parents to analyze green energy stocks, but after seeing the return for 2018 he decided to analyze more stocks for his parents to invest in. Steve liked the data set we created for him, but wanted to analyze the entire market over the last two years.
### Purpose
Our purpose was to help steve analyze stocks in 2017 and 2018. We refactored a code to run through more data at a faster speed. Our code may not have worked with larger data sets. Our goal was to determine whether the stocks were worth investing in based on Volume and Return.
