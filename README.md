# stock-analysis
Analyzing stock using VBA.
## Overview of Project
### Background
Steve was hired by his parents to analyze green energy stocks, but after seeing the return for 2018 he decided to analyze more stocks for his parents to invest in. Steve liked the data set we created for him, but wanted to analyze the entire market over the last two years.
### Purpose
Our purpose was to help steve analyze stocks in 2017 and 2018. We refactored a code to run through more data at a faster speed. Our code may not have worked with larger data sets. Our goal was to determine whether the stocks were worth investing in based on Volume and Return. 
## Results
### Excel Results 2018
Below is the stock results for all of 2018, and we can see that the market had a negative return on average. There were only 2 positive returns for the whole year. Although the volume was good, that doesn't always mean the stock is going to perform well.

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code
As we can see there are some pros and cons of refactoring the code. Some pros are it makes our code cleaner and it runs faster. It also helps Steve because it is easier for him to read and analyze. 
### Advantages and disadvantages of the old vs refactored code
The refactored code is much easier to read and much faster. It also helps us ba able to go back and edit if we need to. It decreased the time taken to analyze the market. However, with the old code it was much quicker and easier to write.
